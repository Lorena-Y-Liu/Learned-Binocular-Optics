        # representing entry nodes have been added to QuickSpin. This allows
        # for the much easier setting of enumeration nodes to new values.

        # The naming convention of QuickSpin enums is the name of the
        # enumeration node followed by an underscore and the symbolic of
        # the entry node. Selecting "Off" on the "ExposureAuto" node is
        # thus named "ExposureAuto_Off".
